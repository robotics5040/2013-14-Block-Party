Naming & Storing
----------------
To keep our file organized, please follow the following rules on naming and storing:

1. **DO NOT MAKE A RENAMED COPY OF A FILE!** Last year, we had v1.6 and v2 and more of a file. Using commits in GitHub, we no longer need to! Doing so will only make a lot of clutter.
2. If you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO create a backup/copy of a file, run it by someone first and then put it in the *Coppies* folder
3. Autonomous programs begin with *Auto* (for example, AutoBridge.c)
4. **Keep the naming consistent!** If related programs start/end a specific way, stick to it!
5. Main programs (that are actually being used) go in the root folder, everything else goes in another folder
 
Please follow these rules! It will help to keep things nice and tidy, avoiding clutter, as well as making it easier to find something.


Releases
--------
Whenever we get to a point where we have a functioning program to where we feel it should be ultra backed-up, that is when we create a release tag. To do so, go to the repository via the GitHub website and click on Releases. Create a new one, and you are done! Make sure to include a changelog that states the changes from the last release to the new one.
